  #Features

1/ The code was made in object-oriented and with a bundler

2/ It feels like the stars are moving but in reality it's the camera
-> the function for the stars was inspired by what we saw in class

3/ There is a small interaction with the user because he is able to change the planet as he wants

4/ I added the features OrbitsControls & FlyControls (smooth zoom, we can turn the camera with the mouse, move with the keyboards) so that the user is more free to move in the canvas

5/ There is also the astronaut dog
